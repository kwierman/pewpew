PEW stands for Process Event-Wise. As this library does multiprocessing, this is PEW PEW.

The need for a multiprocess-based framework for event-wise processing arose in particle physics
dataset whose atomic datatypes are very large. Large datatypes lead to long IO time which bottlenecks
processing time, so having multiple IO processes and independent analysis processes is advantageous.

This framework is thus aimed at data management development and processing frameworks.
